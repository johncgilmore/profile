##about MEEEE

I WANT A JOB, first, so email me at johncgilmore@gmail.com.

My philosophy is 'Measure zero times and nail twice or more as necessary and stay away from knives/saws in general or at least for now. 'Which is to say: if I hammer something into a wall, and I want it straight, I'd rather just put one hole through it, then back up, straighten it out, and put a second hole into it. Doesn't work with glass but it does with stuff my kid draws at school. For other people it makes more sense to use a level. Also tape.

But I do better when I'm pursuing A and B and C with close proximity in time as opposed to pursuing A properly. So I am trying to build 10 dumb projects in 20 working days, or four weeks, whilst myself and my wife and my autistic 5 year old and his twin sister get ready for incoming child number 3 due in two weeks.

Project #1 is this little guy. He'll possibly evolve over time but I don't wanna commit to that. It's a node server that renders this page and nothing else. Cool beans. It's on github at [johncgilmore/profile](https://www.github.com/johncgilmore/profile).
